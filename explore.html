                            Hua-lien, shih (municipality) and seat of Hua-lien hsien (county), eastern Taiwan, the largest settlement and principal harbour on the island’s east coast. Hua-lien is situated on a major fault line at the northern end of the T’ai-tung rift valley, which separates the main Chung-yang Mountain Range of the interior from the rugged and steep coastal ranges between Hua-lien and the smaller port of T’ai-tung. A narrow-gauge railway follows this valley, which is about 4 miles (6 km) wide, and the bustling port is joined to the western parts of the island by a remarkable mountain highway. Located in a highly volcanic region, the city is severely affected by seismic disturbances; it was almost destroyed by a major earthquake in 1951.

                            Opened in 2015, the Hualien Night Market is the largest (and certainly most entertaining) market on the East Coast of Taiwan. Also known as the Dongdamen Night Market, the sprawling wide-laned marketplace is a must visit experience when spending an evening in Hualien.

                            With over 400 vendors at the night market, the amount of food on offer is incredible. And it isn’t just Taiwanese food either, you can find items from mainland China, America, Thailand, Japan and numerous other regions as well.

It was created in 2010 when the former T’ai-pei county was administratively reorganized, and it has the status of a county.

                            New Taipei City is bordered by I-lan (Yilan) county to the southeast, T’ao-yüan (Taoyuan) county to the southwest, and the East China Sea to the north. The special municipality of Taipei and the municipality of Chi-lung (Jilong, or Keelung), both administratively independent, are located within the northern part of New Taipei City. The Hsüeh-shan (Xueshan) Mountains in the southeast, with an average elevation of 4,590 feet (1,400 metres), gradually gives way to the alluvial river basins and coastal plains in the north.

                            Keelung City is located at the northernmost tip of Taiwan’s main island. It was later renamed Keelung during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and when the Nationalists came to Taiwan from mainland China following World War II they made Keelung a provincial city. This port city now boasts an area of 132.76 km2, of which 95% is hilly terrain. Bordered by mountains on three sides and facing out towards the sea, Keelung enjoys an excellent natural harbor with deep water.
                            The Port of Keelung is renowned throughout Taiwan, and worldwide it is a rare case in which the harbor area of a port city flows into the city’s downtown. Keelung currently has seven administrative divisions (or regions), as well as seven islands off the coast, which are Heping Island (lit. “Peace Island”), Zhongshanzi Islet, Tongpan Islet, Keelung Islet, Pengjia Islet, Mianhua Islet, and Huaping Islet. Heping Island (once known as Sheliao Island), Zhongshanzi Islet, and Tongpan Islet are now all connected by land and commonly collectively referred to as Heping Island. But, the scenery of mountains, sea, rivers, and the harbor will change depending on what area or island you are on, so you can plan a host of different sight-seeing routes.

This valley was formerly known as Da Hu Ding. For more than 50 years in the Republic of China, a person from Badouzi brought a group of National Taiwan University Students to play here. At that time, they could not go to the sea and could only play in the valley. They had a great time and forgot about their worries. Hence, they named this place "Worriless Valley." In around year 70 of the Taiwanese calendar, someone wrote "Wangyou Valley" meaning "Worriless Valley," which has been continued to be used up to today. Wangyou Valley is a V-shaped valley. You can relax on the green meadows, see fishing boats, and see the Keelung Island. Tourists then stroll on the ring ridges and valley trails. At night, the fishing spots on the sea and the lights of Jiufenshancheng form a beautiful scene of mountain and sea.</p>

                            With origins as early as 1899, Shilin Night Market is the country’s most famous night market, and also the largest and most crowded in Taipei. Shaped liked an upside down triangle between Jihe and Wenling roads, there are 500+ food vendors here!
                            Keep an eye out for the Shilin Night Market Food Court, an air-conditioned underground food court that provides an ideal escape in summer. If you want to find it directly, take Jihe road up the Western border of Shilin Night Market, and enter right at the first road going in.
                            Despite its size and fame, Shilin Night Market only got one of the 10 spots on the 2018 Michelin Taipei street food list: Hai You Pork Ribs (海友十全排骨). See if you can find it! (it’s at #49 on the main lane through Shilin Night Market—大東路49號).

                            In 2019, Shilin stalls Chung Chia Sheng Jian Bao (鍾家原上海生煎包, 38, Xiaodong Street/小東街38號), specializing in Shanghai-style pan-fried buns, and Good Friend Cold Noodles (好朋友涼麵, #31, Danan Road/大南路31號), specializing in cold sesame noodles were added to the Michelin list.
                            One thing that you may want to seek out at the northeastern side of Shilin (or, much smarter, come in the daytime when there’s no line), is the bubble tea shop Tiger Sugar, a newly opened branch of the chain from Taichung, which also happens to be the homeland of bubble tea (learn where to find the original pearl milk tea shop in my Taichung article).

                            Their drinks are very photogenic (hello Instagram!) but the amazing burned toffee flavor is what really blew me away, and I usually don’t care much for bubble tea.

                            Due in part to its remote location and isolation by mountains from Taiwan's main population centers, Taitung was the last part of the island to be colonized by Han Chinese immigrants (late 19th century). Throughout the 20th century Taitung remained an economic backwater. Sparsely populated even today, this isolation may have been a blessing in disguise, as Taitung mostly escaped the urbanization and pollution that have come to plague other parts of Taiwan.
                            
                            Taitung is a place of many outdoor adventures. Plan a weekend getaway to Green Island or Orchid Island nearby, bathe in the hot springs in Zhiben, take a stroll across the Sanxiantai Bridge, or enjoy the panoramic views from Luye Plateau. In Taitung, you are bound to meet its natural beauty and hospitable people.
