				<p>
					Located in the finest district Taipei has to offer, TAIPEI 101 is the
					largest engineering project ever in the history of the Taiwan
					construction business. Supported by a dozen or so domestic businesses,
					the TFC Corp. was fortunate to have local and international experts in
					charge of the planning, and world-class architect C.Y. Lee was
					responsible for the design of the project. The design transcends the
					unit-body concept and is based on the Chinese number 8, a numeral long
					considered lucky in Chinese culture. Eight-floor structural units are
					connected one by one on top of each other to form the whole. This kind
					of rhythmic aesthetic is new to skyscrapers. The sectional TAIPEI 101
					employs a Mega Structure System for disaster and wind damage
					prevention. As every eight floor constitutes an autonomous space, wind
					effects on the surface seen in high-rise buildings are eliminated. The
					design of the foundation guarantees pedestrian safety and comfort.
					Resembling the flexible yet persistent bamboo that rises into the sky,
					the building is a reflection of traditional Chinese building
					philosophy. Inclining 7 degrees inwards, the structure increases in
					size as it gets higher. The transparent and non-reflective curtain
					walls are energy efficient and heat reflective, enabling those in
					Taiwan's tallest building to have a clear view of the world around
					them. High-tech materials and innovative illumination creates a
					see-through effect with transparency and clarity that facilitates the
					harmony between the building and its natural environment. About TAIPEI
					101 Observatory At 382 meters above the ground the 89F Observation
