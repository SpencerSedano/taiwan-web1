				<h2>The Dongfeng Bicycle Green Way</h2>

				<p>
					The Dongfeng Bicycle Green Way passes through the previous Dongshi
					Branch of Taiwan South-North Railway that connects Fengyuan and
					Dongshi and runs through Dongshi District, Shigang District and
					Fengyuan District. Thanks to the efforts of many people, the route was
					transformed into a bicycle lane in September, 1991 and has been
					renamed as the "Dongfeng Bicycle Green Way" after the gas-run vehicles
					ceased operating. The Dongfeong Bicycle Green Way is a one-lane road
					that can be used by bicycles from both directions. Cyclists can enjoy
					the rolling hills, the changes in the people and in the landscape
					along the way. One can see the dominant culture of the Hakka ethnic
					group amidst vast verdant farmlands crisscrossed by foot paths. After
					the Green Way was opened to the public, a tourist center was
					established in 2003 to better cater for the needs of tourists. From
					where it is located on the Shihgang section, the center commands a
					panoramic view of the adjacent blue Daja River and serves as an ideal
					place for leisure and recreation activities on holidays. Nighttime
					sightseeing has become a new tourist option, when night lighting
					facilities were added to the entire section making it Taiwan's first
					night-time bicycle lane.

					Feng Chia Night Market is within a 1 kilometer radius of Feng Chia
					University. It includes Wen-hua Night Market, Feng jia Road, Xitun
					Road, Fuxing Road and Beacon Sun Plaza. According to marketing
					surveys, it is one of the most popular and visited night markets among
					young people. At weekends, as many as 30,000 people will pass through
					it! It is perhaps the most famous night market in all of Taiwan. Feng
					Chia has all kinds of creative take-away snack foods to sample; it is
					also full of new clothes that are oriented toward young students. They
					are fair-priced and fashionable. A sensory feast for both the eyes and
					palate! (Xitun District)

				<h2>Guguan Hot Spring</h2>

				<p>
					Guguan is situated amidst rugged terrain, with high mountain peaks
					reaching to the sky. The hot springs flow from between the rocks at
					the foot of the mountains all year round. Due to the high sulfur
					content the air is filled with the pungent smell of sulfur when close
					to the springs. It is said that after bathing here the Meiji emperor
					of Japan had a son, leading to the springs being nicknamed “Son
					Springs.”
